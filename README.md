# HelloEOS
Checking the Epic Online Services (EOS) p2p relays in different ways in C++

@todo
- [x] chat
- [x] lite bandwidth checking, in single queue
- [x] make sure that the EOS SDK is not considered thread safe, crash
- [x] 'deferred' approach instead of async
- [x] multi-channeling
- [x] PING-PONG
- [x] measure ping in milli
- [x] gRPC, 'poc' unary calls over UDP
- [-] (declined)more responsible bandwidth measurement
- [ ] UnrealEngine UObject-s Serialize/Deserialize, replication
